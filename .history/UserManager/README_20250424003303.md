# 🧑‍💻 User Manager App

A full-stack CRUD application built to showcase and practice my skills in **Vue 3**, **Axios**, and **ASP.NET Core Web API** with **Entity Framework Core** and **SQLite**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The User Manager App is a full-stack application that allows users to:

- View a list of all users
- Add new users
- Edit existing user details
- Delete users

This app demonstrates a complete understanding of modern frontend development using Vue.js and backend API development using .NET Core, with secure and scalable database interactions using EF Core and SQLite.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### 🔹 Frontend

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with Composition API
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for client-side navigation
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for HTTP requests
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) + [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code consistency

### 🔹 Backend

- [.NET 6 Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/)
- [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for local database
- [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation and testing
- CORS enabled for cross-origin frontend communication

## 🧪 How to Run

### Backend (.NET API)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd UserManagerAPI
```

2. Update the database with the latest migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

3. Run the API:

```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Access Swagger UI:

- Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001/swagger` or `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
- The Swagger UI provides interactive documentation and testing capabilities for all API endpoints
- You can test each endpoint directly from the Swagger interface

### Frontend (Vue)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd user-manager-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Access the application:

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal)

---

## 🔍 API Testing with Swagger

The application includes Swagger UI for easy API testing and documentation:

1. After starting the backend server, visit the Swagger UI at `https://localhost:5001/swagger`
2. You'll see a list of all available API endpoints
3. Click on any endpoint to expand its details
4. Use the "Try it out" button to test the endpoint
5. Fill in the required parameters and click "Execute"
6. View the response and status code

Example API endpoints available in Swagger:

- GET /api/Users - List all users
- POST /api/Users - Create a new user
- GET /api/Users/{id} - Get a specific user
- PUT /api/Users/{id} - Update a user
- DELETE /api/Users/{id} - Delete a user
